Privacy Policy for Workout Diary
Last updated: 22.07.2025

Your privacy is very important to us. The Workout Diary app is designed for personal use to record and track your strength training progress. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

1. What data do we collect?
The app does not collect any personal data automatically.

All workout data (e.g., number of sets, repetitions, weights) is voluntarily entered by the user and is stored locally on the userâ€™s device. The app does not access personal information such as your name, email address, location, phone number, or any other personal identifiers.

2. How is the data used?
Workout data is used solely to display your training history and progress within the app. It is not shared, transmitted, or uploaded to any servers, third parties, or external services.

3. Ads and analytics
The app does not contain any advertisements and does not use analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase). It does not track any user behavior or activity.

4. App permissions
The app does not request any special permissions (such as access to camera, contacts, location, etc.).

5. Your rights
Since the app does not store data on external servers or in the cloud, all information remains on your device. If you wish to delete your data, you can do so manually within the app (if a delete function is available) or by uninstalling the app from your device.

6. Contact
If you have any questions about privacy or the app itself, feel free to contact us:
